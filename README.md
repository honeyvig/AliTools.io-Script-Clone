------------------
To replicate the core functionality of Alitools.io in a custom script while adhering to security practices, compliance, and functionality, you’ll need to create multiple components:

    Backend Service: Handles price tracking, data storage, and API integration with e-commerce platforms like AliExpress and Amazon.
    Frontend UI: Allows users to interact with the system, view price histories, compare products, and manage their preferences.
    Browser Extension: For real-time product tracking and notifications.

Overview of the Solution

Core Features:

    Price Tracking & History: Scrape or integrate APIs from platforms like AliExpress and Amazon to get real-time and historical price data.
    Comparison Shopping: Implement search functionalities that fetch data from multiple sources and compare prices.
    User Dashboard: Show saved products, price histories, and notifications.
    Browser Extension: Use a browser extension to give users access to real-time price information directly while shopping.

1. Backend Development

To store the data securely, you would need a backend service with a database. Here’s a basic outline:
a. API Integration (AliExpress / Amazon)

To scrape data or integrate with e-commerce platforms like Amazon and AliExpress, you can use their public APIs (or scrape data where allowed by their terms of service).

    AliExpress API: You can use the AliExpress Affiliate API to get product data.
    Amazon API: Amazon provides the "Product Advertising API" that allows you to fetch product details, prices, and reviews.

Backend Code Example (Node.js + Express)

mkdir price-tracker-backend
cd price-tracker-backend
npm init -y
npm install express axios mongoose cors

// server.js (Express server to handle API requests)
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/price-tracker', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const ProductSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  url: String,
  price: Number,
  history: [{ price: Number, date: Date }]
});

const Product = mongoose.model('Product', ProductSchema);

// Example route to fetch product info from AliExpress
app.get('/trackProduct', async (req, res) => {
  const productUrl = req.query.url;

  // Use web scraping or API integration here to fetch product data
  // Example with Axios for AliExpress API (you would need to replace with actual API request details)
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.aliexpress.com/product?url=${productUrl}`);
  const productData = response.data;

  // Save to database
  const product = new Product({
    name: productData.name,
    url: productUrl,
    price: productData.price,
    history: [{ price: productData.price, date: new Date() }]
  });

  await product.save();
  res.json({ message: 'Product tracked successfully', product });
});

// Route to fetch price history for a specific product
app.get('/priceHistory', async (req, res) => {
  const productId = req.query.productId;
  const product = await Product.findById(productId);
  res.json(product.history);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Price Tracker API running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

2. Frontend Development (User Dashboard)

The frontend will be the user interface where users can view tracked products, price histories, and compare items.
a. React + Redux Setup

Create a React app for the dashboard:

npx create-react-app price-tracker-frontend
cd price-tracker-frontend
npm install axios redux react-redux

App.js Example (Dashboard)

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);
  const [priceHistory, setPriceHistory] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch tracked products
    axios.get('http://localhost:3000/trackedProducts')
      .then(response => setProducts(response.data));
  }, []);

  const viewPriceHistory = async (productId) => {
    const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:3000/priceHistory?productId=${productId}`);
    setPriceHistory(response.data);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Price Tracker Dashboard</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Tracked Products</h2>
        {products.map(product => (
          <div key={product._id}>
            <p>{product.name}</p>
            <p>Current Price: ${product.price}</p>
            <button onClick={() => viewPriceHistory(product._id)}>View Price History</button>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Price History</h2>
        {priceHistory.map((entry, index) => (
          <div key={index}>
            <p>Price: ${entry.price} on {new Date(entry.date).toLocaleDateString()}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

3. Browser Extension (Chrome Extension)

The browser extension allows users to see real-time product prices as they browse e-commerce websites.
Manifest File (manifest.json)

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Price Tracker Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Track product prices and get notifications",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}

Background Script (background.js)

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Price Tracker Extension Installed");
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  // Extract the product URL from the active tab
  const productUrl = tab.url;
  
  // Call your backend API to track the product price
  fetch(`http://localhost:3000/trackProduct?url=${productUrl}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data);
    });
});

Popup HTML (popup.html)

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Price Tracker</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Track Product Price</h1>
    <p>Click to start tracking this product's price.</p>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

4. Security & Compliance
Data Security:

    Use HTTPS: Ensure that your backend server and APIs are served over HTTPS to protect user data.
    Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user data (e.g., email, passwords) both at rest (in the database) and in transit (while being sent over the network).
    Rate Limiting: Ensure that scraping or API calls are rate-limited to avoid overloading the e-commerce platform and to comply with their API usage terms.
    Terms of Service Compliance: Always check the terms of service of AliExpress, Amazon, and any other platform you’re integrating with to ensure that scraping or API usage complies with their rules.

Compliance:

    Use Affiliate APIs: If using APIs like AliExpress or Amazon, follow their affiliate guidelines and use the official APIs whenever possible.
    User Privacy: Respect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR if your platform stores user information.

5. Documentation

Create a user guide for setting up the system, running the backend, and interacting with the Chrome extension. Provide code comments and clear instructions on how to deploy and use the extension, including:

    Backend setup (API, database, dependencies).
    Frontend setup (React, state management).
    Chrome extension installation and configuration.
    Security best practices and compliance tips.

Conclusion

This solution consists of a backend service to track and store product price data, a React frontend for the user dashboard, and a Chrome extension to provide real-time tracking. Each component is modular, allowing for easy extensions or updates. Be sure to handle security and compliance properly and test the integration with the e-commerce platforms' APIs or scraping solutions to provide accurate and timely price tracking for users.
